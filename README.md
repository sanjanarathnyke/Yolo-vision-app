# Yolo-vision-app

Yolo-vision-app is a project repository intended to provide a computer vision application based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. This application aims to enable users to detect and recognize objects within images or video streams efficiently and accurately.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using the YOLO algorithm
- Easy-to-use interface for running inference on images or videos
- Customizable detection parameters
- Supports multiple object classes

## Installation

> **Note:** As there is no detailed setup or requirements information in the repository yet, please update the following section based on your implementation.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanjanarathnyke/Yolo-vision-app.git
   cd Yolo-vision-app
   ```

2. (Recommended) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your input data (images or videos) and place them in the appropriate directory.
2. Run the main application script:
   ```bash
   python main.py --input path/to/your/image_or_video
   ```
3. View the detection results, which will be saved or displayed as configured.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on YOLO implementation)
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`
